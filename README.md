# Inclusive Research Leadership

This is a repository to develop a set of content to support inclusive research leadership. 

## Are you... :dog:
 
- new to leadership? 
- looking to become a leader in the future?
- unsure of the difference between leadership and management?

This project has come about from a realisation that many people with leadership roles in research and research software engineering have "evolved" into their roles, and many training courses do not address the key challenges of this field. There is also a lack of resources on how to be an inclusive leader, dealing with challenges including psychological safety and supporting diverse teams.

## Contributing :pencil2:

**Inclusive Research Leadership is a collaborative project** and we welcome suggestions and contributions. We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to build the materials and [render on GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/publishing-websites.html). We hope one of the invitations below works for you, but if not, please let us know!

## Acknowledgements :family:

This project originated from a discussion between Tracy Teal (@tracykteal) and Neil Chue Hong (@npch) about how to improve peer support and mentoring for people who had "found themselves" as leaders. 

It was [introduced in a mini-workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12rMH3q2Wd4SGKiF2k5f1IpWNWC3i_o7vKjRYaFiUlqI/edit#)
at the Collaborations Workshop 2022, before a hackday team of Dave Horsfall (@davehorsfall), Hannah Williams (@HWilliams-PHE), Iain Barrass (@ibarrass-qmul), Kim Martin (@K-C-Martin), Lisanna Paladin (@Lisanna) and Neil Chue Hong (@npch) developed scenarios around the topic of hybrid working.
