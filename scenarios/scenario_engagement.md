## Overcoming barriers to engagement in a hybrid team
Some members of the team are struggling to engage with the hybrid nature of the team

### Parameters
Relevant aspects of the problem that has to be considered before designing a solution:
- team size
- team composition (location, personalities)
- "outside-work considerations" (is there some non-work-related problem impacting people's engagement?)
- is the engagement a long standing problem / did it change during the transition to hybrid / is it consistently lacking from someone?  
- remote/office preferences proportion
- accessibility/inclusivity of the team 
    - how prompt is the team in providing relevant information? 
- structure and activity of communication channels
    - how do you ensure that people have the space/technology to have private conversations?
    - languages issues? 
- working hours expectations/possibilities
- workload expectations/possibilities (family committments, caring commitments, etc.)
- your leader definition of engagement (have you as a leader explicitley express the expectations?)
To be customised to "make your own scenario".
